## Project Overview

**Suking Tindahan** (meaning "Favorite Store" or "Regular Store") is a centralized web platform designed to address the growing challenge of content overload and decision fatigue in online streaming, particularly for Filipino audiences seeking local films. This system offers a personalized and emotionally intelligent approach to movie recommendations by suggesting Filipino films tailored to a user's current mood. By integrating with a comprehensive movie database, Suking Tindahan aims to enhance content discovery, improve user satisfaction, and highlight the rich cultural offerings of Philippine cinema.

## Installation (Local Development Setup)

To get a local copy of Suking Tindahan up and running for development or testing, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chrisracha/suking-tindahan.git](https://github.com/chrisracha/suking-tindahan.git)

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project. You will need to obtain an API key from TMDb. Add it to your `.env.local` file:

    ```
    # Example .env.local content (replace with your actual TMDb API key)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    # Add any other environment variables as specified in the project's internal documentation
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if you prefer yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```

    The application will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser.

2.  **Choose a Time Period:** Select your preferred movie era from the available decades (80s, 90s, 00s, 10s, 20s, or All).
3.  **Select Preferred Movie Rating:** Specify the minimum audience rating you desire for the recommendations.
4.  **Adjust Desired Duration:** Use the slider to set a preferred minimum and maximum movie length.

## Future Enhancements (Recommendations from Report)

The project report outlines several recommendations for future improvements:

* **User Accounts & History Tracking:** Implement optional logins to store favorites, mood history, and refine personalization over time.
* **Multilingual Mood Input:** Enhance mood detection to support inputs in Tagalog, Taglish, or regional dialects using advanced NLP models.
* **Collaborative Filtering:** Incorporate a recommendation layer that considers community-based behavior (e.g., "users who felt bored also watched...") to complement mood-based suggestions.
* **Real-Time Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate or mark recommendations for continuous system learning and adaptation.
* **Expand Movie Sources:** Include indie film archives, festival entries, and content from platforms like FDCP's JuanFlix or Cinemalaya.
